# Email-Spam-Classifier-Rpart
A project for classifying email spam using the rpart decision tree algorithm in R. Includes model training, prediction, and evaluation using a confusion matrix

This project demonstrates how to classify emails as spam or not spam using the decision tree algorithm provided by the rpart package in R. The model is trained on the spam7 dataset from the DAAG package, which contains various email features that help determine whether an email is spam.

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to build a classification model using a decision tree to predict whether an email is spam based on given features like the number of capital letters, the frequency of specific words, and other characteristics. We use the rpart algorithm for model building, and the model is evaluated using a confusion matrix for accuracy and performance.

## Features
### Dataset: spam7 from the DAAG package.
### Algorithm: Decision Tree using the rpart package.
### Model Evaluation: Confusion matrix with metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.
## Project Files
### spam_classifier.R: Contains the complete R script for data preparation, model training, prediction, and evaluation.
